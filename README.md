# Hybrid
Hybrid-safety copy

Hybrid(versions & light) should be located in localhost/static/lib
You should have a build.php in the game /app you are building.
Also a any-js ht access file that is NOT provided at this moment.

I will provide a starter project if I continue this, but right now Hybrid is discontinued in favour of MG-(game)engine.
This encorporates a lot of the functionality I started in Hybrid-game.js but never finished 
Also it circumvents the need for Jquery while still supporting every major browser for all it's major versions, back to 5.
Edge is fully supported, IE is no longer considered a Major Browser with that update.
